# Face-Detection-using-Python
Developed a Python application that detects and counts faces in an image using OpenCV. The program loads an image, converts it to grayscale for efficiency, utilizes a pre-trained Haar classifier for face detection, and highlights detected faces by drawing rectangles around them. The result is displayed both numerically and visually.
